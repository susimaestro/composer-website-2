            <h1> Susanne Aubert</h1>
            <p> 
                Susanne moved to London and started her BMus in Popular Music Performance at ICMP. She worked as a professional Jazz vocalist for awhile before shifting focus onto composition. At the music college Susanne had the brilliant composer Maurizio Malagnini (BBC Call the Midwifes) as a teacher and he really opened up her eyes to the world of composing for film and video games and from there she was hooked. 
                <br> <br>Intensive studies got Susanne into and through Berklee College of Music where she got her M.M. in Scoring for Film, Television and Video Games.
                
    
                
                Susanne currently lives in Lisbon where she works as a freelance composer and designer on projects that she is truly passionate about. </p>
